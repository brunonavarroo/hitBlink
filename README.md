# hitBlink
Script from https://answers.unity.com/questions/1134985/sprite-blinking-effect-when-player-hit.html
Just activate the bool to start the blinking of your sprite for the defined time (1 sec by default)

EDIT: added a second file HitstopManager. This is a script that uses Pixelplacement's Surge to create a Singleton. It makes both the hitstop and the hitblink in one place. Might need modification in case you need to deactivate collision while blinking.
